Submitted by: **Lana Do**

Wordle-2 is an app where user can play a basic version of Wordle where users have six attempts to guess a k-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. In this updated app, users have options in settings to increase the number of k-letter words as well as the number of guesses.
